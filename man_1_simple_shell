.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a simple shell created by Jeremy Ola and Hezekiah Ibok. It only has a subset of features compared to dash and csh which it was inspired by.
It can execute files and commands from PATH, as well as conditionally linked statements.
It also offers some builtins which are (cd, alias, env, setenv, unsetenv, history, exit, help).
.SH BUILTINS
Only 8 Builtins are currently supported:
.br
cd - change directory
.br
alias - create a command alias
.br
env - display all environment variables
.br
setenv - set an environment variable
.br
unsetenv - remove an environment variable
.br
history - show the command history
.br
exit - exit the shell
.br
help - display help text for builtins
.br
​
More information about the builtins are provided in their given sections.
.SH cd
Changes the working directory
.SS Prototype:
cd [DIRECTORY]
.SS DESCRIPTION
cd changes the working directory to the given directory. If an argument isn't provided, the $HOME variable is used. If the argument is given as '-', the old working directory ($OLDPWD) is used.
.br
When the cd command is executed, if the DIRECTORY doesn't exists, or the current user doesn't have enough permission to 'cd' into it, an error message is print and the last status variable ($?) is set to 2.
.br
If the directory exists and can be changed to, $OLDPWD is set to the current directory gotten with the sys call: getcwd (as opposed to the variable: $PWD); the current working directory is changed with 'chdir', and $PWD is set to the current working directory after the change. This means that if you 'cd ..', $PWD doesn't become '..', but it rather becomes the absolute directory path from the root.
